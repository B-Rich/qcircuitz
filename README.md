This is a set of quantum circuit macros using TikZ.
The naming convention is attempted as close as the well-established Qcircuit LaTeX package.
With the powerful TikZ support, you may find drawing quantum circuits using this package is as enjoyable as typing equations in LaTeX.

Yet, the reality is that *This is a Work-in-Progress project*.
Contributions are appreciated!
